Build a **portfolio website** for me (name: Dheeraj Gosula) with a modern, minimalistic design inspired by Squarespace, Vercel, Linear, and Cursor. The color palette should be **dark green**, **black**, **white**, and their shades. Use glassmorphism (frosted glass panels, translucent backgrounds) and smooth transitions/animations throughout.

Here are the required pages / sections:

1. **Home / Landing Page**  
   - Hero section with my name (“Dheeraj Gosula”) and a short tagline (you can generate something like “Software Engineer & Designer” or similar).  
   - Subtle animated background or motion effect (e.g., gentle fade-in, parallax, or soft cursor-based movement).  
   - Navigation bar (sticky) with links: About, Projects, Experience, Contact, GitHub (or Links).

2. **About / Personal Info**  
   - A section with a short bio / personal statement.  
   - Education background (school, major, etc.).  
   - Key skills (programming languages, tools).  
   - Possibly a photo (or placeholder) in a glass panel.

3. **Projects**  
   - A grid or list of my major projects. For each: project name, short description, tech stack, and a link (e.g., GitHub or live site).  
   - When hovering over a project card, it should slightly blur / lift / glow (glass effect) with a smooth transition.

4. **Experience**  
   - Previous roles / internships / jobs.  
   - For each: company name, role, dates, and a brief description of responsibilities or achievements.  
   - Use a timeline or clean list layout, styled minimally.

5. **Contact**  
   - A contact form (name, email, message) or just links / icons for email, LinkedIn, GitHub.  
   - On hover, icons should have subtle glass / neon glow or blur background.

6. **Footer / Links**  
   - Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, maybe resume.  
   - A minimal copyright line.

**Design & UI details:**

- Use **semantic HTML5** structure (header, footer, sections, nav).  
- Use **CSS** (or Tailwind CSS — whichever is easier) to style: glassmorphism panels, CSS variables for color palette, dark-mode style.  
- Include **responsive design** so it works well on mobile and desktop.  
- Use **smooth animations/transitions**: fade-ins, hover effects, scrolling transitions.  
- Use a clean, modern font (something like Inter, SF Pro, or equivalent).  
- Incorporate **hidden / Easter-egg UI features** (for example, hidden menu, secret hover interactions, or a small interactive cursor effect).  
- Ensure accessibility: alt attributes for images, good contrast.

**Content:**

- Pull content from my existing website (www.dheerajgosula.com):  
  - Use my existing bio / about text.  
  - Include the same projects and experience I have listed there.  
  - Use my GitHub link(s).  
  - Use contact details / email / social links.

**Technical:**

- Use **pure frontend** (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Make it ready to deploy (on Replit or any static host).  
- Code should be clean, modular, and well-commented.  
- Generate a small **dark-mode toggle** (or default dark green / dark background).  
- Use glass-blur panels that adapt based on scroll position (e.g., navbar becomes frosted glass when scrolling).  
- Add scroll-triggered animations (e.g., sections fade in, slide in).

**Please organize your approach in steps** (plan first, then generate code). Show me a project plan (file structure, components, sitemaps) before writing all the code, so I can approve and then you build it.
